# Project Euler Solutions

This repository contains solutions to various problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). Solutions are implemented in both **Java** and **JavaScript**. The purpose of this collection is educational: to demonstrate different ways of solving mathematical and algorithmic challenges using two popular programming languages.

## Structure

- `Euler-Java/src/` – Solutions implemented in Java
- `Javascript/` – Solutions implemented in JavaScript
- Each file is typically named according to the Project Euler problem number (e.g., `Problem_01.java`, `problem_01.js`)

## Getting Started

### Java

1. Navigate to the `java/` directory.
2. Compile Java files using:
   ```
   javac Problem_01.java
   ```
3. Run using:
   ```
   java Problem_01
   ```

### JavaScript

1. Navigate to the `javascript/` directory.
2. Run JavaScript files with Node.js:
   ```
   node problem_01.js
   ```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you want to add more problem solutions, improve existing ones, or add support for other languages, feel free to open a pull request.
